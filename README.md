# dwarfscript
Program your dwarfish robot and defend your mine.

## Setup

```
npm i
gulp build
open index.html
```

## Demo

A demo is available here: http://feelic.fr/dwarfscript

## Upcoming features

### Near future

#### Variable assignation interpreter

atm, variable assignation is read by the parser but not executed by the processor.

#### Robot documentation generator

The idea is for each module to provide its API documentation, to be displayed on the right of the code panel.

Example:

```
LEGS:
the legs are used to move around. They provide the following functions:
* turn(direction): {clock/counter} makes the unit turn
* forward(): {} makes the unit move forward from 1 tile (consumes fuel)
```

#### Unit execution log

The units should have their own Log method to log execution related messages.

The units should also have their own throw function to catch the exceptions generated by their program interpreter. (The throw function will in turn log messages too)

The GUI will provide a way to read the units log.

#### Collector module and ore

Ore will be lying around the mine and robots will be able to collect it.

### Backlog

* Modules additional program context
* Improve mine design and unit design
* Robot building station
* Robot module catalogue (memory, processor wheels, frame, storage, sensors, etc.)
* Enemies and combat
* `For` loop parser
* Pretty unit move animation
* List of robots
